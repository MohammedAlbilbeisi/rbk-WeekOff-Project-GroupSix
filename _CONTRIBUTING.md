# Contributing

## Group Workflow
-1. Clone done repo and set up environment
    from the command line:

    npm install 
    bower install

0. Make sure master is up to date
   git checkout master
   git pull origin master

1. Create a feature branch
   -naming convention: feature/<name of feature>
   git checkout -b feature/<name of feature>

2. Make small changes on feature branch
   -add individual files NO git add .
   git add <file name>
   or git add -p
   git commit -m <your comment>

3. Update your branch w/current master branch 
   1. git checkout master
   1. git pull origin master
   1. git checkout feature/<name of feature>
   1. git rebase master
     if there are conflicts
       1. Determine conflict
       2. View conflict with: 
         git mergetool
       3. If conflict can be resolved quickly(less than 10 minutes) AND without changing other people's code
          Resolve conflict
       4. If not, just push to your feature branch and let the scrum master know in your pull request

4. Push feature branch to github
   git push origin feature/<name of feature>

5. Make pull request to master


### Make commits to your feature branch. 

Make changes and commits on your branch, and make sure that you
only make changes that are relevant to this branch. If you find
yourself making unrelated changes, make a new branch for those
changes.

#### Commit Message Guidelines

- Commit messages should be written in the present tense; e.g. "Fix continuous
  integration script".
- The first line of your commit message should be a brief summary of what the
  commit changes. Aim for about 70 characters max. Remember: This is a summary,
  not a detailed description of everything that changed.
- If you want to explain the commit in more depth, following the first line should
  be a blank line and then a more detailed description of the commit. This can be
  as detailed as you want, so dig into details here and keep the first line short.

### Make a pull request

Make a clear pull request from your fork and branch to the upstream master
branch, detailing exactly what changes you made and what feature this
should add. The clearer your pull request is the faster you can get
your changes incorporated into this repo.

At least one other person MUST give your changes a code review, and once
they are satisfied they will merge your changes into upstream. Alternatively,
they may have some requested changes. You should make more commits to your
branch to fix these, then follow this process again from rebasing onwards.

Once you get back here, make a comment requesting further review and
someone will look at your code again. If they like it, it will get merged,
else, just repeat again.

Thanks for contributing!

### Guidelines

1. Uphold the current code standard:
    - Keep your code [DRY][].
    - Apply the [boy scout rule][].
    - Follow [STYLE-GUIDE.md](STYLE-GUIDE.md)
1. Run through the app and make sure that your additions/deletions did not break anything
1. Your pull request is comprised of a single ([squashed][]) commit.

## Checklist:

This is just to help you organize your process

- [ ] Did I cut my work branch off of master (don't cut new branches from existing feature brances)?
- [ ] Did I follow the correct naming convention for my branch?
- [ ] Is my branch focused on a single main change?
 - [ ] Do all of my changes directly relate to this change?
- [ ] Did I rebase the upstream master branch after I finished all my
  work?
- [ ] Did I write a clear pull request message detailing what changes I made?
- [ ] Did I get a code review?
 - [ ] Did I make any requested changes from that code review?

If you follow all of these guidelines and make good changes, you should have
no problem getting your changes merged in.
